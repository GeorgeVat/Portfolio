# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my personal projects 
and serves as a comprehensive overview of my skills and experiences. 
It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask, allowing for a dynamic 
and interactive browsing experience. 


# Deploying to Heroku

For deploying the portfolio to Heroku, I followed these general steps:

1. Sign up for a Heroku account at [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com).
2. Install the Heroku CLI (Command Line Interface).
3. Prepare the project for deployment by ensuring it meets Heroku's requirements, such as having a proper `Procfile` and a `requirements.txt` file for Python projects.
4. Connect the local project to a Heroku remote repository using the Heroku CLI.
5. Deploy your project to Heroku by pushing the code to the Heroku remote repository.
6. Configure any necessary environment variables or add-ons required for the project.
